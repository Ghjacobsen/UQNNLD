# Uncertainty Quantification for Neural Networks Using Langevin Dynamics

This repository contains the codebase for the **bachelor's thesis** titled *"Uncertainty Quantification for Neural Networks Using Langevin Dynamics"*, written at **DTU Compute**. The project explores methods for incorporating uncertainty quantification in machine learning, with a focus on applying Langevin dynamics for Bayesian inference in neural networks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, each corresponding to a specific part of the thesis:

### 1. **Chapter2&3: Preliminaries**
   - This folder contains the code related to the foundational concepts introduced in Chapters 2 and 3 of the thesis.
   - Topics covered include:
     - Optimization methods (e.g., SGD).
     - Introduction to sampling methods such as Langevin dynamics.
   - These scripts provide the groundwork for understanding the more advanced topics in subsequent chapters.

### 2. **Chapter4: Bayesian Linear Regression**
   - This folder contains the code implementing Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR).
   - Key features include:
     - Demonstrations of how Bayesian inference works in simpler linear models.
     - Comparison of performance metrics like RMSE and NLL for BLR.

### 3. **Chapter5: Neural Networks**
   - This folder contains the code for applying Langevin dynamics to neural networks.
   - Topics include:
     - Training and uncertainty quantification in neural networks using methods like SGLD and MALA.
     - Evaluation of the algorithms' performance on benchmark datasets.
   - This section highlights the practical application of Langevin dynamics in deep learning.
